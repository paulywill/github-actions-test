# Github Actions Test

Testing the Github actions by following a course by [Michael Jenkins](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-github-actions-2).

This is of course free because of the kindness from my [local library](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/go/barrielibrary) in beautifaul [Barrie, Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrie).
